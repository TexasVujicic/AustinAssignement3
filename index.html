        <h2>Introduction</h2>   
        <P>
            Hello, World!<br/>
            My name is Austin, I am 19 years of Age and currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology to broaden my understanding and add additional documentation to extend my resume, in hopes of expanding my career beyond Desktop Support.

        <h2>Personal IT Experience</h2>
        <P>
            I am currently working full time at Western Health in the IT/Digital Technology Services Department. I currently work as Desktop support on the Service Desk and at times work on Floor support. I have completed a Certificate III in Digital Communication and Media which was part of a Traineeship program that involved me working under a 1 year Contract in Western Health, this later grew to a Permanent job. Prior to this, I had worked in my high schools I.T department to assist with workstations and laptops that have had issues with them. This was part of a program my Information technology teacher offered me as part of extending the learning curve to the students in hopes to entice them into IT, which in my case worked as planned.
        </P>

        <h2>Personal Career Pathways</h2>
        <P>
            My Ideal career within I.T would have to be a server/database surrounded job. Databases have always caught my eye as they have to be intricate but still mapped out neatly and efficiently enough that future/current coworkers can understand. It’s also becoming more and more relied on as systems globally move to cloud based which while difficult is something that I am willing to challenge myself with. Within my current career which exceeded my personal expectations at my age, I have been able to expose myself with Clinical based applications that have databases such as Western Health’s new Electronic Medical records and also the now out of use Bossnet Digital Medical Records. While my experience has been limited with these systems, it is something that has caught my eye.
