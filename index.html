        <h2>Introduction</h2>   
        <P>
            Hello, World!<br/>
            My name is Austin, I am 19 years of Age and currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology to broaden my understanding and add additional documentation to extend my resume, in hopes of expanding my career beyond Desktop Support. I chose RMIT as i see it as a much more reputable university than VU, which i had to move on from as i was offered this permanent position at Western Health and they had no IT related courses that i could take at night or in my spare time Online. I hope in my time in this course i have the ability to learn many Database related systems and that i can expand this into using it in the real world in the workforce.
        </P>
        <h2>Personal IT Experience</h2>
        <P>
            I am currently working full time at Western Health in the IT/Digital Technology Services Department. I currently work as Desktop support on the Service Desk and at times work on Floor support. I have completed a Certificate III in Digital Communication and Media which was part of a Traineeship program that involved me working under a 1 year Contract in Western Health, this later grew to a Permanent job. Prior to this, I had worked in my high schools I.T department to assist with workstations and laptops that have had issues with them. This was part of a program my Information technology teacher offered me as part of extending the learning curve to the students in hopes to entice them into IT, which in my case worked as planned.
        </P>

        <h2>Personal Career Pathways</h2>
        <P>
            My Ideal career within I.T would have to be a server/database surrounded job. Databases have always caught my eye as they have to be intricate but still mapped out neatly and efficiently enough that future/current coworkers can understand. It’s also becoming more and more relied on as systems globally move to cloud based which while difficult is something that I am willing to challenge myself with. Within my current career which exceeded my personal expectations at my age, I have been able to expose myself with Clinical based applications that have databases such as Western Health’s new Electronic Medical records and also the now out of use Bossnet Digital Medical Records. While my experience has been limited with these systems, it is something that has caught my eye.

        <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
        <p>
                <a href="https://westernhealth.mercury.com.au/ViewPosition.aspx?id=5K3wZW73KLc=&jbc=ere "> https://westernhealth.mercury.com.au/ViewPosition.aspx?id=5K3wZW73KLc=&jbc=ere </a><br/>

                This job is somewhat similar to an ideal career/job I want to achieve. Being Internal to my current workplace, this provided a fantastic insight into what is required to be qualified to achieve this job. While it doesn’t highlight exact tertiary educations as this can be very broad (such as a bachelor of information technology) it does require Extensive knowledge in the essentials part of the Position description (.pdf file that is viewable in the weblink). These consist of SQL server knowledge and competencies, XML and also .NET framework knowledge.
                
                In terms of non-Technical essentials, it does require effective and efficient communication to all levels of technology understanding. This is something I personally believe is something I have a Forte to, as this was an essential to me applying for a Service Desk agent position at Western Health. 
                
                Currently my skills are shared very well in the desirable category of this Position Description, I have extensive knowledge of ITSM tools, and have experience in IT delivery of new systems, as I was involved heavily in the rollout of the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system currently operating in a successful functional state across Western Health.
                
                A lot of these requirements are less to do with a Bachelors degree or something done in a broad degree itself, many of these require extra certifications that can be funded personally or can be funded by my workplace in an attempt to give me more exposure to apply to my current workplace, as an additional hand at any complex system may provide a better operational environment. This not only involves Database administration but also Security Administration and Change management strategies.
